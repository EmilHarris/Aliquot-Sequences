    "\n",
    "In Week 3 we designed some useful functions, namely `factorial` to compute the factorial of non-negative number $n$ and  `fib_iter` and `fib_rec` to compute the $n$ th Fibonacci number, either iteratively of recursively respectively.\n",
    "Let's say we want to use these functions in other code, for example in other functions or in this Notebook. Well in that case we save them in a *simple text file* with extension `.py`, i.e. a python file and **not** a jupyter notebook. Roughly speaking,  a collection of python functions contained in a single file,  is said to be a **module** (or **library**) of functions. (Libraries can in fact contain different types of data such as classes.) Now to use these functions we need to import them. Then we can simply call them in the present code that we are writing. We thus have two main steps in this process. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: create, edit and save a python file (script) \n",
    "\n",
    "We have two main options for this. \n",
    "- Use a text editor such as *Notepad*, *Gedit*, *Atom*, *Sublime*, *Visual Studio Code (VS Code)*, *Emacs*, *Vim* (among others) to create, edit and save the file. \n",
    "- Use an Integrated Development Environment (*IDE*)  such as *Spyder* (supplied by Anaconda) to create, edit and run the code in your file and to save the file. Again there are a number of other *IDEs* such as *Idle*, *PyCharm* or *Visual Studio* (different to VS Code). You can also add functionality to text editors such as *Atom*, *Sublime*, *VS Code*, *Emacs* and *Vim* so as to use them as *IDE*s. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our advice is that you learn to use *Spyder* or *VS Code*  to do  this. Next week there will be a short video  covering the use of *Spyder*. For this week we will take a short cut: inside Jupyter we have the possibility of creating, editing and saving a python file/script. (Remember that this is just a text file.) In cases like the present $-$ when the editing basically consists of copying and pasting $-$ this is a perfectly good way of proceeding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note.** Be careful to save your file in your current working folder - i.e. alongside this notebook (or else on the python path if you know what that is).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Our Example.** We now create, edit and save a file called `week3_functions.py` using the editor built into the Jupyter. (This will take place during the video of the lecture.) We save it in our present working directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: import and implement the functions \n",
    "\n",
    "We have created the file `week3_functions.py` which contains the functions `factorial`, `fib_iter` and `fib_rec`. From  the Python interpreter's point of view the code inside this file (i.e. definining these functions) is a **module** called `week3_functions`. (Note that the `.py` extension is not included here.) We can now import this module. In fact we have several options as follows. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import the module as is: \n",
    "```python \n",
    "import week3_functions\n",
    "```\n",
    "or using an alias \n",
    "```python \n",
    "import week3_functions as w3_funs\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now, suppose that we want to compute the factorial of $10$. Then in the first case we use the function call `week3_functions.factorial(10)` and in the second case we use `w3_funs.factorial(10)`. "
   ]

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "2. Import functions individually. For example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from week3_functions import fib_iter, fib_rec \n",
    "```\n",
    "Then, supposing that we want to compute Fibonacci number with index $15$ we simply call `fib_iter(15)` or \n",
    "`fib_rec(15)` (depending on whether we like the iterative or recursive function). Note however that `factorial` has **not** been imported. \n",
    "- Import all the functions in the module using the (so called) *wildcard* `*`: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "from week3_functions import *  \n",
    "```\n",
    "In this case we can call and use all of the above functions: each of the calls `factorial(10)`, `fib_iter(15)` and `fib_rec(15)` will work as expected. \n",
    "\n",
