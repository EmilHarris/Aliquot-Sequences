Since the function works by continuously dividing n until it reaches 1, if we find a number we have already factorised during the dividing process we straight away know the factorisation of the original number. For example, lets say we know $15 = 3 * 5$. Then if we have $n = 60$, first the function will divide by 2 twice.
