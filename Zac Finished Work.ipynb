    "## Aliquot Sequences - An explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand an aliquot sequence, we furst have to get behind the notion of a  $\\textbf{proper divisor}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A proper divisor of a positive integer $𝑛$ is any positive integer divisor of $𝑛$ other than $n$ itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if $n=12$, \n",
    "\n",
    "Then the divisiors of $12$ are: $1,2,3,4,6,12$\n",
    "\n",
    "And the proper divisiors of $12$ are: $1,2,3,4,6$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this idea of proper divisiors, we can define the sum of proper divisors, $s(n)$, for a postive integer n to be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ s(n) =  \\displaystyle \\sum_{d \\mid n,\\, 0 < d < n} d $$\n",
    "\n",
    "'It gives the sum of all positive divisors of n, excluding n. Interest in this function goes back to the Pythagoreans (6th century B.C.E.). Aliquot sequences are the seqeunces formed by repeatedly applying this function.'\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\newline$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition of the sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "For each $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, an Aliquot Sequence, $A_n$ is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ A_n = \\{n,s(n),s^2(n), s^3(n), ... \\} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where we have already defined $s(n)$ as the sum of the proper divisors, and where $s^2(n) = s(s(n)), \\  s^3(n) = s(s(s(n))),...$etc\n",
    "\n",
    "If $s^j(n) =0$ for some $j$, the sequence terminates after $j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\newline$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interesting facts about Aliquot Sequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Perfect Numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "A perfect number is a postiver integer $n \\in \\mathbb{N} $, where $s(n) =n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, $6$ is a perfect number. The proper divisors of 6 are $1,2,3$. Thus, $ s(6) = 1+2+3 = 6$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Perfect Numbers are interesting. For starters, all known perfect numbers are even, and they have a specific formula for this, discovered by Euclid in 300 BC:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{Even Perfect Number} = 2^{p-1} \\cdot (2^p -1) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This doesn't mean that there are no odd perfect numbers, it is just that no mathematican has ever discovered one. It is said that it must be very lager, greater than $10^{1000} $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perfect numbers also grow very quickly. For instance, the first 6 perfect numbers are: $ 6,28,496,8128,33550336,8589896056 $, so the 6th perfect number has 10 digits! \n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding Aliquot Sequences, a perfect number $n$ creates a stable sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example $A_6 = \\{ 6,6,6,6,... \\} $. Unlike most sequences, if $n$ is perfect, $A_n$ will continue forever with complete infinite repetitions of n, and will not decrease to 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\newline$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Amicable Numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Two numbers, $a$ and $b$ (where $a,b \\in \\mathbb{N}$) are said to be amicable if:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ s(a) = b \\quad \\text{and} \\quad s(b) = a $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the sum of the proper divisors of a is b, and the sum of the proper divisors of b is a.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's look at $220$ and $280$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$s(220) = 1+2+4+5+10+11+20+22+44+55+110 = 284$ \n",
    "\n",
    "$s(284) = 1+2+4+71+142 = 220 $\n",
    "\n",
    "If a pair of numbers are amicable, it makes the Aliquot sequence for both numbers have loop of lenght two.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, $A_{220} = \\{ 220,284,220,284,20,.... \\} $ which has a loop of two. This is the same for $A_{284}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Like an Aliquot Sequence of a perfect number, a sequnce of an amicable number does not decrease to 0, but simply loops back and forth between the two numbers to for ininity.\n",
    "\n",
    "More Examples of amicable numbers are: $(1184,1210), (2620,2924), (5020,5564) $\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there is no definite formula to generate all the amicable number pairs, Thabit ibn Qurra discovered a formula in 9th century that generates some amicable pairs. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\newline$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sociable Numbers \n",
    "\n",
    "Sociable numbers are numbers that form longer amicable chains. This means that if we add the positive divisors of a postive integre $n$, and then proceed to add the positive divisiors of the result, we can continue the process until we retunr back to n. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus: $$ s(a) = b \\quad s(b) = c \\quad s(c) = d ..... s(p) = a $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "is a loop of sociable numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example: $ s(12496) = 14288, s(14288) = 15472, s(15472) = 14536, s(14536) = 14264, s(14264) = 12496 $\n",
    "\n",
    "Therfore, the Aliquot Sequence for 12469 is: $ A_{12496} = \\{ 12496,14288,15472,14536,14264,12496,..... \\}$, which is a looping Aliquot Sequence of period 5. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\newline$\n",
    "$\\newline$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Different Types of Aliquot Sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "'Surprisingly little is known about aliquot sequences. It is easy to see that there are three possible types of aliquot sequences:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Those which terminate at zero\n",
    "     \n",
    " 2. Those which enter a loop.\n",
    "     \n",
    " 3. Those which continue infinitely but do not contain repeats.\n",
    "     \n",
    "It is not currently known whether there are any of type 3 but equally it is possible that most aliquot sequences are of this type. The goal of this project is explore these sequences computationally.'\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\newline$\n",
    "\n",
    "'One of the difficulties is that calculating s(n) becomes computationally difficult once n is large because it involves factoring n into primes. Our project will consist of two main parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Write code to compute some aliquot sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Use this code to explore questions about these sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The efficiency of our code will determine how effectively we can investigate the sequences'\n",

    "### Finding s(n)\n",
    "We are going to start off our coding in the hunt to compute an aliquot sequence for any given acceptable number (acceptable meaning up to a point where the computer can handle the size of the number without crashing) by finding an algoirthm to compute s(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to define a function s(n). \n",
    "If the number inputted to the function is 0 or 1, then we can state that the sum of prime divisors is going to be 0 form our knowledge, and we dont want 0 or 1 disrupting our algoirthm.\n",
    "If the number is greater than 1, then we are going to start by setting a variable called 'total_sum' equal to 0. This is going to be constently appeneded/added to until it reaches the correct s(n) for a given number. \n",
    "We then say a for number d in a range 1 to the square root of n + 1, if we divide n by a all values of d in this range, and if the remainder is equal to 0, then we will continue through the code. (If we imagine the factors pairs for any given number, all the values of d that divide n are the smallest numbers of the factors pairs.)\n",
    "So we will now add d to total_sum. \n",
    "If d is not the square root of the number n, or 1, then that means the other number that d makes in its factor pair will be less than n, and a proper divisor that has not already been added to total_sum as it is greater than the square root of n.  \n",
    "Once we have been through the whole range of 1 to the square root of n +1, we return total_sum, giving us s(n)."

    "### Improving the code of the Classification \n",
    "We are very confident in the efficiency of our code above, but we are now going to test the limits of how large n_max, k_max and i_max can go so we can run the code in approximately 30 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to set up an experiment function, which will test multiples combinations of n_max, k_max and i_max. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we are going to loop over all n from 1 to n_max, and for each n generate the aliquot sequence and its status. We will then classify and tally all the sequences like above, and measure the run time for each combination of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will show the results in a table, and then decide which combination of parameters will be the most reasonable to use as an improvement on the last question. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data in the table is from the code that is in ''' '''. This code takes 974.61 seconds, or 16 minutes to run. The data is copied from when the cell has been ran, and been put nicely into a table. \n",
